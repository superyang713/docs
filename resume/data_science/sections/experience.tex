{Jun. 2017 - Exp. Jun. 2019}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item {Studied interaction between molecular hydrogen and modified Nickel/Gold
    surface alloy with numeric and analytical tools.}
\item {Explained and matched experimental observations to theoretical models
    using fitted statistical simulations and analytic solutions.}
\item {Transitioned data analysis method from conventional Excel-like
    spreadsheet to Python Scripting for improved automation and result
    reproducibility.}
\item {Presented research results to general as well as expert audiences
    through seminars, conferences, talks, and posters.}
\item {Daily use of Linux Shell and Python scripts to automate tasks.}
\item {Created a custom docker image that contains all the necessary packages
    for lab data analysis.}

\cventry
{Research Assistant}
{University of Utah}
{Salt Lake City, Utah}
{Aug. 2011 - May. 2017}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item {Designed, fabricated and maintained a sophisticated surface science
    apparatus from the ground up, as a result of a collaboration with 7 other
    research institutes.}
\item {Created multiple data analysis templates for processing and analyzing
    large datasets generated from the custom instrument.}
\item {Wrote LabView programs for data acquisition and system control.}
\item {Preliminary results disagreed with those documented by our collaborator.
    As a result, designed and conducted additional experiments, and upon data
    interpretation and literature search, discovered nanoparticle size effect.}
