\lettersection{About Me}

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Machine Learning
Engineer position at DarkVision, an innovative company in the field of imaging
technology. I am confident in my ability to perform as a Machine Learning
Enginner at DarkVision due to my extensive education and research experience.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why DarkVision?}

AI is undoubtly the next big thing and DarkVision is actively meshing data
science with its superior imaging technology. And as a physical chemist with the
background of both engineering and data science, DarkVision is definitely one of the
few companies that can truly appreciate my value.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Throughout my research history, I have been working on
sophisticated surface science instruments. I even designed and built various
equipments for the purpose of my research, so I can fully appreciate and
comprehend the delicacy and complexity of your data and ultra-sound imaging
system.

In my current research role at MIT, I use Python extensively (Numpy, Pandas,
Sci-kit Learn). I might be a physical chemist, but I am a fast and active
learner. There was once a project proposal that required me to develop a web app
to monitor our research equipment condition in real time. It was a short project
(2 weeks), so I had to rapidly learn and apply new multiple skills within days,
such as Django, JavaScript, and AWS. I am therefore very confident that I could
quickly ramp up and add value to your team - both in Python-based work; and any
other languages/tools/algorithm you use.

I love coding and data science, and I truly believe programming is the closest
thing we human can get to magic. I do everything I can in a text editor, and
even this cover letter is written in LaTex with Emacs.  I have actively pursued
numerous data science courses and attended seminars at MIT to build my knowledge
base; and frequently applied techniques I have learned to my work. I have
channeled this passion into a personal blog as well. I now want to apply this
passion in my everyday work - especially in a team like yours that values
intellectual excellence.
