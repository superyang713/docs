\lettersection{About Me}

I was pleased to learn of the available Data Science position at Integrate.ai.
With my Phd degree in Physical Chemistry and six years of experience managing
data-related solutions under my belt, I am confident I will be a valuable asset
to your team.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Me?}

In my current role as a postdoc at MIT, I have been afforded the unique
oppotunity to spearhead a project focused on big data processing. This project
has allowed me to drastically expand my predictive analytics and feature
extraction capabilities. Through my contribution, the project has produced
substantial meaningful results for our research. I am well versed in deriving
viable solutions to complex scientific problems through data analysis and
management.

During my PhD studies at the University of Utah, I worked extensively with
machine learning and data mining techniques to infer the coverage of
size-selected metal clusters deposited on a single crystal. I was also
responsible for using data visualization techniques to generate meaningful plots
for research findings publishing and presentation. I worked on a large
collaborative project, involving seven other research institutes. Working
closely with other groups allowed me to hone my interpersonal skills
and the ability to present complex technical information to non-expert personnel.

I am a fast learner and never afraid to try out new things. Over the years, I
have developed many interests in the field of programming, such as web
development, cloud computing, and Shell scripting, and put them into practice.
There are two surface science instruments in my lab that requires constant
monitoring to prevent liquid nitrogen shortage, so I decided to build a webapp
to monitor our research equipment condition in real time. It was a side
project. I rapidly learned and applied multiple new skills within days,
such as Django, JavaScript, and AWS, and finished the app within a week. I am
very confident that I could quickly ramp up and add value to your team - both
in Python-based work; and any other languages/tools/algorithm you use.

Thank you for your time and for considering my candidacy for this position. I
look forward to hearing from you in the near future to schedule an interview.
