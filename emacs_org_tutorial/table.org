* Tables
Hopefully you can see straight away that the simple structure provided by
org-mode gives a nice way to keep an electronic note book.

Often it is nice to include tables in our notes. Org handles this by using | to
separate columns, and a line of --- (inserted with C-c -) to add horizontal
lines.

Excercise: start typing in this table below; type the first line in verbatim
 1) when you get to the "s" of comments, press TAB to go to the next line
 2) go up to the previous line and use C-c - to add the row of dashes
 3) next enter a few lines of data, using TAB to go through the cells - you
    should notice the columns changes width as needed

| ID | x |  y | comments       |
|----+---+----+----------------|
| A  | 2 |  4 | blah           |
| B  | 3 |  9 | blah           |
| C  | 4 | 16 | blah blah blah |
| D  | 5 | 25 | blah           |

Now, you can move rows and columns around using M-arrow and insert or delete
rows and columns using M-S-arrow. Try this out now.

The same command can easily convert some text to a table; select the following
text and use C-c | to run the command org-table-create-or-convert-from-region
again to convert the text to a table

| ID | x |  y |
| A  | 2 |  4 |
| B  | 3 |  9 |
| C  | 4 | 16 |
| D  | 5 | 25 |

You can also save tables to their own files by putting the cursor in the table
and using M-x org-table-export. You'll be asked for a file name and a
format. For the format, type orgtbl-to and press TAB to see the available
options (e.g. orgtbl-to-csv will convert to csv in the output file).

** Formulae
You can use formulae to do arithmetic on tables, and use them like a
spreadsheet. This is something I keep meaning to use more often, but don't
generally find I need it. One useful command is C-c + which runs org-table-sum
to sum the numbers in the current column.
