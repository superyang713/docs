* Links and images
Org mode supports links to files, URLs, and to other points in the org file. In
this example, let's use an image from my website. First copy it to the current
directory. You can do this within emacs but for now just run this command in
your terminal.

curl http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/bjm/superman_cluster.gif -o superman_cluster.gif

To add a link to a file use C-u C-c C-l and type the name of a file. Use
tab-completion to select the image we just copied and you will then be asked for
a description - you can press enter to leave this blank. This will create a link
that looks like this

[[file:superman_cluster.gif][test]]

If you do this in your org file, you won't see the [[]] above, instead you'll
see the text as a clickable link.

Since the file we have linked to is an image, we can tell emacs to display the
image in the document using C-c C-x C-v and use the same command to turn the
image off again. 

You can also click the link with the mouse, or use C-c C-o to follow it, which
might open your web broweser, an image viewer or open a file in emacs depending
on the target of the link.

The structure of a link in org mode looks like this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[link address][description]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

(I've enclosed the link in an example block which prevents org-mode from trying
to interpret as a real link, for the purpose of showing its structure - we'll
come back to the blocks like this later.)

The link address is the URL or file name, and the description is the text that
is displayed.

Links to web pages are easy - just put the http address in as the link
address. Use C-c C-l as a quick way to add such a link (remember we used C-u C-c
C-l is for adding a link to a file).

Finally, we can add a caption and a name to our image like it

#+CAPTION: Superman and a galaxy cluster
#+NAME: fig.super
[[file:superman_cluster.gif][test]]
