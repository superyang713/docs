* Emacs Learning Journal
I have been using vim ever since I started programming. Recently I am planning
to switch to Emacs because I have heard a lot of good things about it. Emacs is
such a beast to tame, so I am writing this note (written in Org mode) to remind
myself of some useful tips and packages I have encountered during the Emacs
learning journey.

** Useful Packages
 - Org Mode
   This note is actually written in Org Mode. It is an awesome plugin for
   keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and authoring documents with a fast
   and effective plain text system.
 - Magit
   A plugin dedicated to git version control system.
 - Company
   A front end auto-completion plugin.
 - Spacemacs-dark theme
   An Emacs theme used by Spacemacs Project.
